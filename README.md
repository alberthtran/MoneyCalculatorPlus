## Author's Notes:
Please note that this repository is a replica of my private project on GitHub. The project was written in Objective-C and hasn't been maintained for over 8 years, so it might not build. This is for reference only. I plan to update this project when I find time so that it will work in the latest Xcode environment.

## Developer's Partner:
I developed this application with my college friend, Wilson Kong.
